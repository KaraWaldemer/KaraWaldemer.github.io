### Who am I?

Hello, my name is Kara Waldemer. I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for JavaScript and writing front-ends to websites. I graduated from <a href="http://www.slu.edu" target="_blank">SLU</a> in December of 2013 with a BS in Computer Science and I have been pushing myself to grow and try new things ever since.

<br/>

##### Work

I am currently working at <a href="https://ocelotconsulting.com" target="_blank">Ocelot Consulting</a> as a Senior Software Engineer. I am a full stack developer with experience solving problems in a number of different business domains using a number of different technologies. 

<br/>

##### Family

My family is very important to me and a large portion of what I do is through the lens of making them proud and giving me the time to spend with them. In particular I would like to thank my wonderful wife, Jackie, for all of her love and support, even when I geek out and ramble endlessly about technology and programming.

##### Hobbies

I enjoy spending my free time with Jackie as well as our dog and two cats. Whether that is hanging out at home or going out and doing something fun, I am happy spending time with them.

<br/>

I am also an avid reader and have found very few books that I don't enjoy in some fashion or another. In particular I am a fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy (I know, shocking right!). My absolute favorite book series is  <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com/Books/index.php" target="_blank">The Wheel of Time</a> by Robert Jordan. If you haven't heard of it or haven't taken the time to check it out, I highly recommend it. It is a long series but well worth a read.  

<br/>

Additionally, I have done a lot of work in the past with the local Saint Louis LGBT community. This is an area that is very near and dear to my heart and I do not hide that part of my life so in the future I might break out a new blog relating to that work.
