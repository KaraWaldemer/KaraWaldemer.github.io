Mentoring is a very broad topic. It is something that most people are giving/receiving in some form or another every day. Any time you ask a question or show someone how to do something new, you are participating in mentoring. A post talking about all the different ways mentoring has affected my life would be way too long, and frankly, pretty boring. Instead, I am going to focus on the mentoring I have participated in at work, primarily around mentoring new developers.

##### Mentoring I Have Experienced

Even after narrowing it down to my experiences with mentoring at work, there are plenty of different experiences to discuss. When I joined Monsanto as an entry level software developer, I was the recipient of a great deal of mentoring and I would be nowhere near as successful as I am today without it. Since then, I continue to receive mentoring on a regular basis but I am also able to provide mentoring to others as well. I have done this in one on one as well as group settings, by answering a simple question, leading tech talks and classes, and, most recently, by being the dedicated, on team, mentor for teams of new entry level developers. Each of these different instances of mentoring I have participated in have had a profound impact on my personal and professional skills.

##### My experience being mentored as an entry level developer

I joined Monsanto as an entry level developer directly out of college. I was placed on an existing development team made up of people with many more years of experience than me. I was paired up with one of those senior developers as my on-boarding buddy. Essentially his job was to be my initial point of contact and source of information and learning that would help me meld with my team and get up to speed with what we were working on. When I started, I was a very unfortunate mix of shy/nervous and stubbornly convinced that I could figure everything out and become a fully contributing member of the team in a very short amount of time. I hesitated to ask questions because I was afraid I would look incompetent or be bothering my fellow team members. Luckily, I was working with some amazing people who fully understood that I wasn't going to join the team knowing everything. They readily reassured me that I would not be thought less of for asking questions, instead it was encouraged.

Even with their reassurance, it took me awhile to break out of my shell and really understand the benefit that having a group of people available to answer my questions and help me learn new concepts. It's not that I was incapable of learning it on my own, it was just faster, more efficient, and a heck of a lot less frustrating to ask for help when I needed it. Once I realized and accepted that fact, I was really able to start growing. Having a team of people who were genuinely interested in seeing and helping me to succeed really made the difference for me. I didn't feel like just another cog in the machine that could be replaced if I proved that I wasn't perfect. This gave me the confidence to try new things knowing that someone would be there to help me get back on track if I lost my way and that even if I did lose my way and have to take a step back, I would still have learned something and that my team would not hold it against me. I was given the freedom to try new things, make mistakes, and learn on my own and with the help of those working with me. This has made me so much stronger as a developer and a team member.

##### My experience mentoring individually/informally

Even though it took me longer than I, naively, thought when I joined the company, I quickly became a fully functioning/contributing member of my team. I even became something of the team "expert" in certain technologies or portions of our domain. I still regularly relied on the advice and mentoring of fellow developers but I was getting to the point where I was able to give back. It was a really proud day for me when I realized that other developers, most of them "senior" to me, were coming to me with questions and that I could answer them!
