Mentoring is a very broad topic. It is something that most people are giving/receiving in some form or another every day. Any time you ask a question or show someone how to do something new, you are participating in mentoring. A post talking about all the different ways mentoring has affected my life would be way too long, and frankly, pretty boring. Instead, I am going to focus on the mentoring I have participated in at work, primarily around mentoring new developers.

##### Mentoring I Have Experienced

Even after narrowing it down to my experiences with mentoring at work, there are plenty of different experiences to discuss. When I joined Monsanto as an entry level software developer, I was the recipient of a great deal of mentoring and I would be nowhere near as successful as I am today without it. Since then, I continue to receive mentoring on a regular basis but I am also able to provide mentoring to others as well. I have done this in one on one as well as group settings, by answering a simple question, leading tech talks and classes, and, most recently, by being the dedicated, on team, mentor for teams of new entry level developers. Each of these different instances of mentoring I have participated in have had a profound impact on my personal and professional skills.
