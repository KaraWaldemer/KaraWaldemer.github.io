A couple of weeks ago I was asked to give a ten minute presentation to one of our tech organizations on the importance of diversity in the work place. Naturally, I was eager for the opportunity. I am passionate about the importance of diversity both in and out of work and I can talk about it for hours. Additionally, it was going to be a fantastic opportunity to share such a big part of my life with some of my co-workers. Lastly, I was glad to see that the leaders of our tech organizations werent just throwing the diversity buzzword around, they were following through and showing that they really do value it. I quickly replied that I would be happy to come talk. As the day of the talk got closer and closer, I began to sort though my thoughts and form my presentation and I almost immediately hit a roadblock. What the heck was I going to talk about? This was not the first time I had spoken about diversity in a workplace, like I said, I have content and passion to talk for hours, but how do I take all that information and compress it down into a ten minute presentation? It seemed impossible and I did not know where to begin! I started asking around about where to start and my Agile Coach, Doug Birk, had some really great advice. He told me to think about the one thing I wanted my audience to take away from my presentation. Find that one thing and the facts that support it and you have your presentation. It is such simple advice, but it really helped me get on my way. So I sat down and thought about it, what was the one aspect of diversity that I wanted them to take away from my presentation. Once I thought of it, it was so glaringly obvious, I couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it before. What is the goal of any software tech organization? To build great software for our customers. With this in mind, I decided to focus my presentation on how diversity in the workplace directly correlates to better software and with that, I was off. In my mind there are two major areas where diversity plays a crucial role in software development. The first is the people who write the software.
